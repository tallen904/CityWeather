# FreightWise-Test
Software developer test for FreightWise, LLC

/**
* Software Developer / Intern application test.
*
* Doing research and making API calls are an important part of what we do at FreightWise.  This test will
* demonstrate your abilities to:
*
* - Make an API call
* - Research an API
* - Do basic DOM manipulation
* - Parse data
* - Handle errors
* - Be creative
*
* Feel free to ask any questions you may have.  Use a lot of comments, and explain why you are doing things.
* Don't spend more than 1-2 hours on it - we aren't expecting a finished product.  Feel free to use any third
* party libraries, and if you do so, explain why you used them instead of built in browser APIs.
*
* Instructions:
* - Use the axios (https://github.com/axios/axios) request library to make an API call to the OpenWeatherMap
*   API for Current Weather Data using this API key:  25e989bd41e3e24ce13173d8126e0fd6
*   We've already imported this library to get you started.
* - Use either async/await or Promises.
* - Get the weather for Brentwood, TN, and write it to the DOM using the `setResults` method below.  Be
*   creative and make it look nice.
* - Handle errors and use the `setError` method below to display the error.  Also make it look nice.
* - If you find any mistakes in the test, fix them, and leave a comment about what you fixed and why.
* - Make sure your code is readable and maintainable.
* - Use plenty of descriptive comments.
* - Make sure your code runs in the latest version of Google Chrome and Firefox (ES6 is allowed).
* - Zip up your finished test and send it to hr+software@freightwisellc.com.
*
* Bonus (pick one, not required, but they give you a chance to show off if you finish quickly):
* - Sign up for NewsAPI.org and get the Top Headlines and show them along with the weather.
* - Use the browser location API to get the user's current location, and show that location's weather.
* - Show a satellite map of the weather in Brentwood.
* - Add a reusable dev console logger that shows ISO 8601 DateTime, class name, and all arguments passed in.
